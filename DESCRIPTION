Description: Computation of t-year survival probabilities and t-year
    risks with right censored survival data. The Kaplan-Meier estimator
    is used to provide estimates for data without competing risks and
    the Aalen-Johansen estimator is used when there are competing risks.
    Confidence intervals and p-values are obtained using either usual
    Wald-type inference or empirical likelihood inference, as described
    in Thomas and Grunkemeier (1975) <doi:10.1080/01621459.1975.10480315>
    and Blanche (2020) <doi:10.1007/s10985-018-09458-6>. Functions for
    both one-sample and two-sample inference are provided. Unlike Wald-type
    inference, empirical likelihood inference always leads to consistent
    conclusions, in terms of statistical significance, when comparing
    two risks (or survival probabilities) via either a ratio or a difference.
